The purpose of this study is to analyze a product experiment to identify the characteristics influencing consumer preference. This study is focused on television specifically. . The experiment was conducted using a questionnaire, from which the responses were gathered before we moved on to the analysis. The goal of this analysis is to determine which attributes consumers value the most when buying a TV and what is their willingness to pay for each feature. Next, market shares were determined by simulating a market with two different customer profiles.
